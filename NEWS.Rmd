## Release 1.10 2019-02-19

First real version of README. Renamed and refactored top-level file. See below.

Changed, new, and deleted files

- `README.Rmd`
    - First version of README doc

- Rename top level `R/ovrfx.R` to `R/run.R` and move data generation code to `R/dodata.R`. When writing README, I saw that old scheme made it hard to explain how to run program

- `R/doc.R`
    - Improve management of figure and table labels - numbers, prefixes, suffixes
    - Add `sect_start` function to adjust figure and table labels at start of new section
    - Change `need.init` default in `dodoc` to F - works better with current `init` scheme
    
- `R/doc_readme.R`
    - Support first version of README doc
    
- `R/init.R`
    - Update defaults for `readme` doc
    - Change figure and table labels per new scheme in R/doc.R
    
- `R/plot.R`
    - Fix xlab, ylab defaults when x, y are not defaults

- `R/util.R`
    - Fix bug in loess smoother when data column names are not valid formula symbols

## Release 1.01 2019-02-16

Support posted version of `ovrfx` blog post.

## Release 1.00 2019-02-14

Support third version of `ovrfx` blog post. Final or near-final version.

Changed files

- `R/doc_ovrfx.R`
    - Remove the 'zoom' figure (old figure 2)
    - Add 'sampling distribution' figure (new figure 3)
    - Use theoretical meand calculations for 'average significant effect size' (figure 4) and numbers in text

- `R/init.R`
    - Unify parameters for fixd simulation (used for empirical meand calculation) and theoretical meand calculation
    
- `R/ovrfx.R`
    - Turn theoretical meand calculation on again
    
- `R/plot.R`
    - Minor cleanup of plotpvsd

- `R/stats.R`
    - Fix blunder in d_d2t. Have to scale by sqrt(n/2) to account for difference in x-density
    - Mistake also in repwr/R/stats.R, which I will fix separately
    
- `css/html_document.css`
    - Add css for blockquote. Rmd's built-in blockquote style sets the font too big
    - Solution from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44191576. Thanks!

## Release 0.90 2019-02-13

Support second version of `ovrfx` blog post. Current title "When You Select Significant Findings, Youâ€™re Selecting Inflated Estimates". Not final version but close.

Major code changes

- Abandon file caching. Way more trouble than it's worth
- Handle multiple types of simulation
    - `rand` - the original siumulation scheme: randomly choose `d` and run one simulation per choice
    - `fixd` - more typical simulation scheme: set `d` to certain fixed values and run many simulations for each value
- Handle two ways of calculating  mean significant effect sizes, 'meand'
    - `empi` - estimate empirically from simulation data
    - `theo` - theoretical calculation from sampling distribution

Changed files

- `R/datman.R`
    - Add functions to `save` and `load` new file types: `sim_rand`, `sim_fixd`, `meand_empi`, `meand_theo`
    - Replace generic functions, eg, `save_nd`, by ones specific to each file type. Though seemingly less factored, it's way simpler now that I've abandoned caching, esp. since we have so few file types at present
    - Remove `keep` functions. These supported now-abandoned file caching
    - Remove caching related code from `save` and `load` functions
    - Redefine `get` functions to be synonyms for `load`. Previous distinction was needed for now-abandoned file caching
    
- `R/doc_ovrfx.R`
    - Near complete rewrite for second version of blog post

- `R/init.R`
    - Add params for multiple types of simulation: `sim_rand`, `sim_fixd`
    - Add params for calculation of mean significant effect sizes: `meand`
    - Remove params for caching: `load`, `keep`, `clean.cache`
    - Remove code for initializing cache
    - `datadir` no longer has `m` component. Makes no sense with multiple simulation types

- `R/ovrfx.R`
    - Add function for `fixd` simulation and rename function for original `rand` simulation: `dosim_fixd`, `dosim_rand`
    - Add function for empirical calculation of mean significant effect size and rename function for theoretical calculation: `domeand_empi`, `domeand_theo`
    - Incorporate new `R/datman.R` functions for saving files
    - Remove code for getting data from cache if possible

- `R/plot.R`
    - Add function to plot histogram: `plothist`
    - Fiddle with 'extra' line params and code. Removed specialized params like `d.crit` and `d.pop` in favor of the more general `vline` and `hline`
    - Add `x0` param to `pval_legend` function to adjust location. Crude but adequate for immediate needs
    - Add convenience function `d2col` that maps `d` values to colors by combining `d2pval` and `pval2col`

## Release 0.50 2019-02-03

Support first real version of `ovrfx` blog post ready for external review. Current title "Significance Testing Makes Bad Choices"

- Rename repo from `effit` to `misig`. Better reflects the content I expect for this repo
- Rename first blog post from `siglo` to `ovrfx` - stands for 'overestimate with fixed effect size'

## Release 0.10 2019-01-01

First version. Contains boilerplate files such as this one and the document `sigbi.Rmd` (presently just a stub). Will contain code to support the document when released.
